# LD-Light
Small project with particles photon board for me and my girlfriend. Lamp that activates on touch in an random color and also activates all other lamps in the network with the same color. 
Project is adaped from https://www.instructables.com/id/Networked-RGB-Wi-Fi-Decorative-Touch-Lights/ but the code is changed in a way that it can be run without the raspberry server and only over the particel cloude.
Adaption for more than 2 lamps is easily possible, but I only built the project for 2 lamps.
